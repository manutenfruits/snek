# Snek

Ugly but usable snake game. [Try it out here!](https://manutenfruits.github.io/snek).

## Launching

Just do `npm i` to install dependencies, and launch `npm start`. This will start a server on `localhost:8080`.

## Building

`npm build` will create a folder `dist` with the output.

## How to play

Use the arrows or WASD to move the snake. The goal is to eat the apple (red square) in the board without hitting the walls or yourself. If you grow so big there's no spot to put a new fruit, you win the game and my respect. If you lose, just refresh the page to have a go at it again.

## Future work

The code could use a better UI, as the focus was put on logic and not prettiness. It could definitely use less developing tools, but what modern thing can you do these days without babel/webpack/etc?
